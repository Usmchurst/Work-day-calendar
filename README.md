# Work-day-calendar
This is a work day calendar that displays to time which allows you to enter the taskes that you need to get done in the day. It is color coded to display current time in Red, The future tiome in green and the past time in gray. 

# Code 
I had to write Javascript code linking the HTML file to allow the calendar to work properly. 
In additon I had to create and use custom Jquery library functions to tasks like link the calendar times so they will work in squence. THe functions that are used to ensure the colors change are coded using Jquery. I had to also use Moment.JS to enter the time so the calendar can update when the time changes. If, else conditional statements were used in order to ensure the calendar funtions properly also.
